                        <p style="color: azure;">Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his<br>
                            Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available during the 20th<br>century. 
                            One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, <br>an American
                            car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.Development of the automobile started in 1672 with the invention of the first
                            steam-powered vehicle, which led to the creation of the first steam-powered automobile
                            capable of human transportation, built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769. Inventors
                            began to branch out at the start of the 19th century, creating the<br>de Rivas engine,
                            one of the first internal combustion engines, and an early<br> electric motor.Samuel Brown later tested 
                            the first industrially applied<br> internal combustion engine in 1826.
                            Development was hindered in the<br> mid-19th century by a backlash against large vehicles, <br>
                            yet progress continued on some internal combustion engines. The engine<br>evolved as engineers created two- and four-cycle combustion engines and began using gasoline as fuel.<br>
                            The first practical modern automobile and the first car put into series production appeared<br>
                            in 1886, when Carl Benz developed a gasoline-powered automobile and made several identical<br>
                            copies. Later automobile production was marked by the Ford Model T, created by the Ford Motor<br>
                            Company in 1908, which became the first automobile to be mass-produced on a moving assembly line.

                       While you may not see hovering vehicles on the streets anytime soon, you will see other<br>
                       impressive feats of mobility technology. From autonomous-driving cars to hydrogen<br>
                       fuel-cells to fully electric engines, we're already seeing a shift in the auto industry.<br>
                       <b>The electric car</b><br>
                       Electric was the first phenomenon to transform cars. When it was first introduced,<br>
                       experts envisaged a specific use â€“ for public transport for example. Beating the<br>
                       predictions, electric cars are slowly emerging as a must-have in all the market segments.<br>
                       <b>The autonomous car</b><br>
                       The first two stages have already been completed. Cruise control has existed for<br>
                       several years: drivers can set a cruising speed and remove their feet from<br>
                       the pedals. And some cars now offer driver assistance systems that make it<br>
                       possible to remove the hands from the wheel in specific situations such as<br>
                       in traffic jams, or when parking, etc.</p>
